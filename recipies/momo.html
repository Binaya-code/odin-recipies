    <p> ### Ingredients:<br>
        
        **For the Filling:**<br>
        - 250g (1/2 lb) ground chicken<br>
        - 1 cup finely chopped cabbage<br>
        - 1/2 cup finely chopped onion<br>
        - 2-3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
        - 1-inch piece of ginger, minced<br>
        - 2-3 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)<br>
        - 2 tablespoons soy sauce<br>
        - 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br>
        - 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
        - 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander<br>
        - Salt and pepper to taste<br><br>
        
        **For the Dough:**<br>
        - 2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
        - 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
        - 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br>
        - Water, as needed<br><br>
        
        ### Instructions:<br>
        
        **1. Prepare the Dough:**<br>
           1. In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt.<br>
           2. Add the oil and mix it into the flour.<br>
           3. Gradually add water, a little at a time, until the dough comes together and is smooth and elastic. This should take about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of water.<br>
           4. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.<br><br>
        
        **2. Prepare the Filling:**<br>
           1. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger, and sauté until fragrant.<br>
           2. Add the chopped onion and green chilies. Cook until the onions are translucent.<br>
           3. Add the ground chicken, soy sauce, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper. Cook until the chicken is fully cooked and the mixture is dry. Stir occasionally to break up the chicken. Remove from heat and let it cool.<br><br>
        
        **3. Assemble the Momos:**<br>
           1. Divide the dough into small balls (about the size of a walnut).<br>
           2. On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball into a thin circle, about 3-4 inches in diameter.
           3. Place a spoonful of the chicken filling in the center of each circle.<br>
           4. Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape or pleat the edges to make a pouch.<br>
           5. Pinch the edges together to seal the momo. You can use a fork to crimp the edges if desired.<br><br>
        
        **4. Cook the Momos:**<br>
           1. If you have a steamer, place the momos in the steamer basket lined with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking. Steam for about 10-12 minutes, or until the dough is translucent and the filling is cooked through.<br>
           2. If you don’t have a steamer, you can use a large pot with a steaming rack. Fill the pot with a small amount of water, place the rack over it, and steam the momos.<br><br>
        
        **5. Serve:**<br>
           1. Serve the momos hot with your favorite dipping sauce. A simple dipping sauce can be made by mixing soy sauce with a bit of vinegar, minced garlic, and a pinch of sugar.<br>
